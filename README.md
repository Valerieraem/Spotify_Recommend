### Spotify_Recommend
**Creating spotify recommendations using spotipy API**<br>
Used Kaggle dataset of 6K playlists on Spotify and collected 250,000 songs from the playlists in the dataset 
using Spotipy (spotify's API). In this project I am using a subset of 35,000 songs in order to keep API calls to a minimum.<br> 
Using track features and playlist data to generate recommendations using different recommendation algorithms. 
Most programming is done in python and I use Jupyter Notebook to clean the data and keep everything organized.
